# NobleNumbatWallpapers

I have been using Ubuntu since its first version (in my first laptop, a Toshiba, in my university years) and have been a fan ever since.

This year marks my 20th year using Ubuntu so I want to start to contribute back to express my appreciation.

Drawing on my passions for photography and design, I’ve decided to participate in the upcoming [24.04 LTS release Ubuntu Community Wallpaper Competition](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-24-04-wallpaper-competition/42300).

* Fuwafuwa Nanbatto-san (ふわふわ ナンバットさん) - Mascot

    * Hikari/Light Version with Ubuntu Colors (Ubuntu Orange and Canonical Light Aubergine)

    * Yume/Dark Version

* Mount Fuji, Japan - Nature
